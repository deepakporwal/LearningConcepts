Linq key points :

 LINQ has a 3-layered architecture in which the uppermost
 layer consists of the language extensions and the bottom layer
 consists of data sources that are typically 
 objects implementing IEnumerable <T> or IQueryable <T> generic interfaces. 

 A set of extension methods forming a query pattern is known as LINQ Standard Query Operators.

 LINQ standard query operators can be categorized into the following ones on the basis of their functionality.

	Filtering Operators
	Join Operators
	Projection Operations
	Sorting Operators
	Grouping Operators
	Conversions
	Concatenation
	Aggregation
	Quantifier Operations
	Partition Operations
	Generation Operations
	Set Operations
	Equality
	Element Operators


-- traditional connection logic --

SqlConnection sqlConnection = new SqlConnection(connectString);
SqlConnection.Open();

System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand sqlCommand = new SqlCommand();
sqlCommand.Connection = sqlConnection;

sqlCommand.CommandText = "Select * from Customer";
return sqlCommand.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection)
